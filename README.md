Changes made:

Due to multiple technical difficulties, I had to make significant adjustments to my app project. In part 2 of the assignment, I was unable to use VS Code because my emulator wasn't functioning properly, which forced me to use another app for development. Additionally, I faced challenges with GitHub, which unfortunately resulted in not receiving a mark for that portion of the project. As a result, I had to restructure the app, change screen names, and rewrite sections of code to make the app function correctly. Despite these setbacks, I was able to complete the app and make it operational. So basically, I had to redo the whole app.

I'll be submitting my part2 app Aswell to showcase the difference.
